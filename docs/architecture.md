# Architecture

## Goal

Keep the first version of ApplyPilot small, easy to reason about, and easy to deploy.

## System Boundaries

- `frontend/`: user interface built with `Next.js` and `TypeScript`
- `backend/`: API layer built with `FastAPI`
- `PostgreSQL`: primary application database
- `Supabase Auth`: authentication provider

## Backend Layers

- `api/`: request routing, versioned endpoints, and request dependencies
- `core/`: settings, security helpers, and shared error handling
- `db/`: SQLAlchemy base definitions, database connectivity, and session usage
- `models/`: SQLAlchemy ORM models for the MVP schema
- `schemas/`: request and response schemas
- `services/`: business logic layer
- `alembic/`: database migration history

## Auth Flow

1. The frontend uses `Supabase Auth` for email/password sign-up and sign-in.
2. Frontend middleware protects `/app/*` routes by checking the current Supabase session.
3. Authenticated frontend requests send the Supabase access token as a bearer token to the backend.
4. The backend verifies the token, resolves the current user, and can map that user to a local `profile`.

## Applications Flow

1. An authenticated user opens `/app/applications`.
2. The frontend calls `GET /api/v1/applications` with the Supabase bearer token.
3. The backend resolves the current profile and enforces ownership through `profile_id`.
4. The applications service applies filtering, search, sorting, and CRUD operations against PostgreSQL.

## Dashboard Flow

1. An authenticated user opens `/app`.
2. The frontend requests dashboard summary counts, status breakdown, and overdue/upcoming task lists.
3. The dashboard surfaces only current-user data through the shared profile ownership model.
4. Recent applications are pulled from the existing applications endpoint to keep the overview page lightweight.

## Application Workspace Flow

1. An authenticated user opens one application detail page.
2. The frontend loads the application summary plus linked contacts, linked tasks, and application notes.
3. Notes, tasks, and contact links are managed from the same page to reduce context switching during daily follow-up work.
4. The backend enforces ownership on every related record through the current profile and parent application.

## MVP Core Schema

- `profiles`: local profile record mapped to a `Supabase Auth` user
- `applications`: tracked opportunities and current job-search status
- `contacts`: recruiters, hiring managers, referrals, and networking contacts
- `application_contacts`: many-to-many links between applications and contacts
- `tasks`: follow-ups and reminders optionally tied to an application or contact
- `notes`: freeform notes optionally tied to an application or contact

## Core Relationships

- One `profile` owns many `applications`, `contacts`, `tasks`, and `notes`
- One `profile` owns many `application_contacts` links
- `applications` and `contacts` connect through `application_contacts`
- `tasks` can belong to an `application`, a `contact`, or stand alone under a `profile`
- `notes` can belong to an `application`, a `contact`, or stand alone under a `profile`

## Current Backend Scope

The backend scaffold currently includes:

- app entrypoint and versioned routing
- a health endpoint at `GET /api/v1/health`
- an auth identity endpoint at `GET /api/v1/auth/me`
- environment-based settings
- starter error handling
- SQLAlchemy models for the MVP core schema
- Alembic migration setup for the current schema
- Supabase bearer-token verification and a current-user dependency pattern
- applications CRUD with profile-scoped ownership enforcement
- contacts CRUD with application linking
- tasks CRUD with due-date filtering and completion support
- application-linked notes CRUD with note types for interview/call/follow-up context
- dashboard summary endpoints for pipeline visibility and next actions

## Intentional Omissions

The scaffold does not yet include:

- richer domain services beyond the current applications, contacts, and tasks features
- richer domain services beyond the current applications, contacts, tasks, and notes features
- richer domain services beyond the current applications, contacts, tasks, notes, and dashboard features
- seed data
- deployment configuration
- CI workflows
